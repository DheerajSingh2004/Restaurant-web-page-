                <h3>Chainsoo</h3>
                <p>It's a very popular Garhwali dish made of Urad or Kali Dal and therefore contains a lot of protein. It might take some time for some people to digest because of its high protein content, but this dish has a very earthy flavour that is definitely worth trying. Toasting the lentils first and then making a fine paste out of it is the first step in the preparation of this delicacy. You will enjoy the aromatic flavour of this popular Uttarakhandi food, particularly because of its unique cooking method of holding it on a slow flame in an iron kadai.</p>
